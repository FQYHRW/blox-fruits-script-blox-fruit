## 🎮 What Is a Blox Fruits Script?

A **Blox Fruits script** is a Lua-coded automation tool designed for the Roblox game **Blox Fruits**. These scripts are executed using third-party tools known as **executors**, which allow you to run custom code within Roblox games. 

Once activated, a script can automate virtually any aspect of gameplay—such as **farming enemies**, **auto completing quests**, **fruit tracking**, and **teleporting across islands**. For players who want to progress faster or avoid repetitive tasks, using scripts is a game-changer.

## 💡 Key Features of Blox Fruits Scripts

Scripts vary in complexity, but the most useful ones tend to include some or all of the following features:

**Highlights:**

- Continuous attack loops
- Automatic healing and repositioning
